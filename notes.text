🔐 Login System Upgrade Ideas (Practice-Style)
🧱 Basic Features

    ✅ Minimum password length (e.g., at least 6 characters) DONE

    🔁 Confirm password when registering DONE

    🔒 Hide password input (like real login forms do) DONE

    🕐 Track login time (show when a user logs in successfully)

🗂️ User Management

    👥 Store multiple users using a dictionary or list

    📝 Save users to a file so they persist after the program ends

    🔄 Load users from file when the script starts

🚨 Security and Control

    📛 Block certain usernames (like admin, root, etc.)

    🧠 Prevent duplicate usernames during signup

    🧼 Force lowercase usernames for consistency

    ⏳ Add a 5-second timeout between failed login attempts

    🔁 Lock out a user after 3 total tries ever (not just per session)

🧠 Smart Feedback & UX

    👀 Show the number of registered users

    🟢 After login, display a simple menu like:

        View Profile

        Change Password

        Logout

    🧮 Add a simple “account age” tracker (how long since account created)

🎓 Advanced Stretch Goals (for later)

    🔐 Password hashing so passwords aren't stored in plain text

    📧 Add email or phone field to user profile

    🧾 Log every login attempt (timestamp, success/failure)

    🧱 Create classes like User and turn your code into an OOP design
